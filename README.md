# ip-funnel.sh

ip-funnel.sh is a script designed for port forwarding on Linux using iptables. While this approach may not be the conventional method (typically handled by routers), ip-funnel.sh provides a straightforward way to manage port forwarding directly from your Linux installation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of ip-funnel.sh is to simplify the process of setting up port forwarding using iptables on Linux systems. It aims to offer a flexible and scriptable solution for users who prefer to manage their network configurations without relying on external routers.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have iptables installed on your Linux system. If not, install it using your package manager (apt, yum, etc.).

#### Make ip-funnel.sh executable:

```bash
chmod +x ip-funnel.sh
```

#### Run the script:

```bash
./ip-funnel.sh
```
